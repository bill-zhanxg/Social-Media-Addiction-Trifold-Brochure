                    media is a great tool for communicating with people that you can't meet with in real life very
                    often. Chances are, you've most likely used it yourself. Some examples of social media are <a

                    Social media was originally created as a tool for people to communicate with each other when they
                    can’t meet up in real life, adding to the joy of talking with friends and family. It can also be
                    used to communicate with a teacher or others about stuff. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"
                        target="_blank" class="link">YouTube</a> for example, you just saw a
                    funny video and want to share it with someone, social media is something you could use to accomplish
                    that.

                    YouTube’s main purpose is to give people an opportunity to create enjoyable content and earn money,
                    or just watch some videos! These videos can be educational, funny, even sad - of course those are
                    only some genres that are contained without the vast world of YouTube.
                    Some companies use YouTube to create ads to promote themselves, or their products/apps. Other times
                    people just create reviews, gameplay videos and other content like VLOGs for the enjoyment of users
                    and the profit of making videos.

                    Snapchat is a great way of chatting with friends, playing games, taking selfies and more. It has
                    some good features including an easy-to-use interface that allows you to subscribe and follow
                    people, receiving notifications whenever they post something.

                    It’s very easy to take selfies and photos with Snapchat, coming with a lot of AI edits, filters,
                    effects, and music that is all there, and you could use it whenever you want to improve your posts.
                    Same with Instagram, it has a lot of images editing feature too. But Snapchat is way more kids
                    friendly and Instagram is more for business uses.

                    TikTok is a social media platform that has taken the favour of many people around the world. On
                    TikTok, you can make shorts of you singing, or doing something funny for the entertainment of
                    others. When people are bored, a lot of the time they may go to social media, TikTok in this case
                    and scroll through clips to find some joy. The best part of TikTok is that because the videos are
                    short, they're plentiful and even easier to make (most of the time). YouTube later included shorts
                    feature due to the popularity of them in hopes that they may gain more support and users.

                    common way is to show users ads. To make companies want to use your app (the social media) as their
                    promotion tool, you first need to make yourself popular right? When a lot of users use your social
                    media platform, companies will want to promote their products using your social media app because a
                    lot of people will see it, so the social media companies need to innovate some ways to make users

                    YouTube just a tool for us to learn and have fun? Well, that’s not the whole truth. YouTube wants
                    people to create videos, you may be a content creator yourself and make YouTube videos, it might be
                    YouTube shorts, or some video for teaching. But when you think you’re creating the videos for the
                    community, you’re actually helping YouTube to get more people using their platform. If your videos
                    are good more people may want to watch future uploads, sometimes leading an inspiration for other
                    viewers to start wanting to create their own videos, either having fun or joining the race for the
                    youtuber with the most subscribers. That is part of what encourages peoples’ goals for YouTube.

                    This is the Same for TikTok, it works just like YouTube but with more videos because they are all
                    shorts. This means they can earn more by ads because you’re constantly scrolling through more clips
                    because they’re so short. Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram all work in similar ways too, but with
                    things called stories and feeds.

                    Social media not only draws you attention into spending all of your time scrolling through feeds,
                    wasting it, it also contains a chat feature that can cause a lot of problems like cyberbullying,
                    issues communicating in real life because you chat too much digitally.

                    self-esteem, cyberbullying and
                    other online issues. You might be wondering how can social media can cause depression? There might
                    be multiple reasons: the first one is online bullying. Online bullying happens a lot because people
                    just don’t feel like bullying someone in real life or are just too scared to be seen doing it, so
                    they turn to bullying digitally on social medias.

                    The second most common reason is due to not achieving the goal they set, in terms of follower count
                    for example, sometimes even likes. Other times things can go wrong and people might laugh at in you
                    in real life because of it.

                    main design feature that keeps people checking is when the app keeps trying to survive in the
                    background avoiding being shut down by the operating system so it can show you any notifications you
                    get. I.e. someone sends you a message or someone you follow posts. When you get a like on your post
                    or a message, other examples included, your brain receives a rush of dopamine that makes you want to
                    stay on longer to feel more of the pleasure your brain has tied to social media.

                    Social media is just like drugs, when you take it, it’s barely possible to escape. Some people says
                    just delete your social media account or delete the app, or set screen time to help reduce our time
                    on social media. But that doesn’t help at all! My opinion is kind of different than the others. If
                    you just gonna delete the app or set screen time, your brain is still thinking about social your
                    posts, messages and others. So it’s gonna make everything more worse. That means your brain is still
                    thinking about and trying to achieve the dopamine. Not a lot of people have a strong self-control,
                    so to actually reducing social media time it’s not that simple like “delete the app” or “just don’t
                    use it”. Even a lot of adults have a lot of time spent on social media.

                    So how to actually reduce the time on social media? Well, first you need to know what’s the goal on
                    social media. You probably using social media because of board, can not find anything to do. You may
                    use social media because there are funny things in there that make you laugh. Or you may use social
                    media because of chatting with friends, but ended up scrolling infinitely. As I said in the
                    beginning, social media was supposed to be a tool for making people joy, and a tool for people to
                    communicate if they can’t achieve it in real life, not for the purpose of addiction. But I feel like
                    the companies just going too far for the monies.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container transition ease-in-out delay-200 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-105">
                    • First of all, I think most the company is actually the one make people addicted to their app just
                    for money, I know this probably isn’t a thing that we could change, but it’s a nice thing to know
                    about.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container transition ease-in-out delay-200 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-105">
                    • If your social media goal is for joy, why can’t you find something else for joy that’s is good for
                    you? Like I like piano and programming. This website is hand coded by me, and I enjoy it because
                    when I see the final result of my website I feels very proud of myself for having the ability to
                    coded something amazing and useful. Same with piano, I know it’s probably a pain starting to learn
                    or do something. Like when I wasn’t this good at piano, I worked really hard for it. So now I’m
                    grade 7 at piano, and I could enjoy myself playing it. Even if I just play it as a hobby, I can
                    still feel joy when playing it. You shouldn’t say that you can’t fid anything that could make you
                    happy, there is like millions of things that you can do. How about just trying some new things?
                    After trying a lot of them you should be able to find something that makes you joyful. But make sure
                    don’t give up too easily, after hard & smart work you should receive joy.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container transition ease-in-out delay-200 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-105">
                    • But if you active on social media only because you want to talk to someone, there is really
                    nothing much you can do about it. As I said, social media is a tool for communication, so I guess
                    you use it the right way. But there is a better thing to do instead of chatting online, why not just
                    play in real life? I guess if people don’t really want to you don’t get a choice for this.

                    Discord is a chat app that’s is way different than the other social media. In my opinion, it’s not
                    actually a social media. And Discord said themselves in <a

                    like any other social media with super user-friendly interface, if you want to create Discord
                    servers, you actually need to learn how the permission stuffs works. So that means they achieved the
                    actual purpose of social media and I love it because it’s super developer friendly.

                    not only a chat app that let you chat with others, it’s also super developers friendly. If you don’t
                    know how to code, it’s fine. There is a thing called server on Discord. That basically allows you to
                    invite anyone on the internet with links, and you can give them a thing called role for changing
                    they permission. But if you know how to code, Discord is a good option, even if you are starting,
                    it’s a very good option because either if you use JavaScript, Python, C# (.NET), TypeScript, or even
                    some language that’s is not too common to interact with Discord API. I suggest use discord.js
                    because it’s pretty easy to setup and have a lot of packages to use with node.js. There is a thing
                    call bots in Discord, you can basically interact with the Discord API to control how the bot works.
                    And if you’re building a website, you can use Discord built in embed for servers. But make sure you
                    have read Discord developer terms of services (Discord Developer Portal — Documentation — Legal)
                    before making them so you won’t get in trouble. If you want to actually want to work the Discord
                    app, it’s a really good place too. All the developer are very chill even on social media like
                    YouTube, and they have a really nice work space for you. You can work wherever you want in the
                    building (35 Reasons to Work at Discord - YouTube). And it’s pretty simple to apply jobs at Discord
                    too (Jobs and Career Opportunities at Discord).

                    I really enjoy Discord because the company is not trying to make their app addictive, so there is no
                    feeds, stories, or other things that will addict you. Because of that, Discord doesn’t show you any
                    ads. Their purpose isn’t trying to use you as their workers. But how do they make money then?
                    Discord has a very special way of doing it, and I think it’s pretty smart. The main way for them to
                    earn money is by the thing call nitro, it’s basically a perk that allow you to do more stuff on
                    Discord like screen sharing up to 60fps and source resolution. But not many people need it. There is
                    already a lot of things you can do without nitro. They’re just giving you an option to buy it or
                    not. The other way they money is by partner with other companies like PlayStation, Xbox, Games like
                    Fortnite and others. So they could receive some money from them because they’re basically promoting
                    them. But while promoting Discord give the user more joy of using their app because the app is made
                    for gaming. Nowadays people use it for a lot of things like helping developers, make server for
                    friends so they can talk, but the promoting doesn’t really bother them because they’re not showing
                    in your profile when you’re not playing the game.

                    Social media is a drug that when you addicted to it, it’s really hard to stop using it. But there
                    are some ways to make it a useful tool. If you’re still using apps like Snapchat, Instagram,
                    Facebook, I suggest you that you could think about switching to Discord. Because I call them
                    terrible apps. You could learn how to use Discord, it may take a while when you get use to it, but I
                    think it’s worth to switch. If you’re not using any social media, just stay like it. Don’t try
                    social media just because they’re terrible. If you can’t stop using social media, maybe try more
                    activities in real life! Don’t forget who you are and what’s real what’s not. The real life it’s
                    actually fun if you find the thing you like. So go explorer, you’ll eventually find the thing you
                    like (except using social media or playing games).
